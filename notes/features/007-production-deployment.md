# Phase 7: Production Distributed Deployment

## Plan

### Overview
Phase 7 focuses on preparing Aiex for production deployment with Kubernetes integration, cluster-wide performance optimization, distributed monitoring with telemetry aggregation, and multi-node operational excellence. This phase transforms our distributed AI assistant into a production-ready system capable of horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

### Goals
1. Implement cluster-wide performance optimization with distributed profiling
2. Configure Kubernetes-native deployment with libcluster and auto-scaling
3. Create comprehensive distributed monitoring and observability
4. Setup distributed release engineering with Mix releases
5. Build developer tools for distributed debugging and operation

### Architecture Decisions

#### Performance Optimization Strategy
- Use `:recon` for distributed performance analysis across nodes
- Implement FastGlobal pattern for frequently accessed hot data
- Coordinate benchmarks across nodes using Benchee
- Create Mnesia-specific optimization strategies
- Add node-specific GC tuning based on workload

#### Kubernetes Deployment Architecture
- Use `libcluster` with Kubernetes.DNS strategy for automatic cluster formation
- Implement production supervision trees with restart strategies
- Create Helm charts for flexible deployment configuration
- Setup horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) based on metrics
- Implement graceful shutdown with connection draining

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Aggregate telemetry data across all nodes using pg process groups
- Export metrics to Prometheus for cluster-wide monitoring
- Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Create structured logging with correlation IDs
- Build real-time dashboards for operational visibility

#### Release Engineering
- Configure Mix releases with runtime configuration
- Support multi-architecture container images
- Implement blue-green deployment strategies
- Create automated rollback procedures
- Setup distributed health checks
