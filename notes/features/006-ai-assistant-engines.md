# Feature 006: Phase 6 AI Assistant Engines Implementation

## Plan

### Overview
Implement the core AI assistant application logic that provides actual coding assistance capabilities. This builds on the existing distributed infrastructure (Phases 1-5) to create the AI engines that users interact with for code analysis, generation, explanation, refactoring, and testing.

### Architecture Integration
The AI engines will integrate with existing infrastructure:
- **LLM.ModelCoordinator**: Multi-provider LLM coordination with circuit breakers
- **Context.Manager**: Distributed context management and session handling  
- **InterfaceGateway**: Unified request routing from all interfaces
- **Events.EventBus**: Distributed event publishing for metrics and coordination
- **LLM.Templates.TemplateEngine**: Structured prompt templates with context injection
- **Existing supervision tree**: Proper fault tolerance and process isolation

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 6.1: Core AI Assistant Engines
**CodeAnalyzer Engine**
- Structural analysis (complexity, patterns, dependencies)
- Security vulnerability detection
- Code quality metrics and suggestions
- Integration with existing tree-sitter parsing

**GenerationEngine**  
- Module and function generation from specifications
- Documentation generation for existing code
- Template-based code scaffolding
- Context-aware variable and function naming

**ExplanationEngine**
- Code explanation with multiple detail levels (brief, detailed, tutorial)
- Algorithm and pattern explanation
- Architecture documentation generation
- Interactive Q&A about codebase

#### Phase 6.2: Advanced AI Engines  
**RefactoringEngine**
- Safe refactoring suggestions with impact analysis
- Code smell detection and fixes
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Integration with existing AST analysis

**TestGenerator**
- Comprehensive test suite generation
- Property-based test creation
- Mock generation for dependencies
- Test coverage analysis and gap identification

#### Phase 6.3: AI Assistant Coordinators
**CodingAssistant**
- Multi-engine workflow orchestration
- Conversation state management
- Complex multi-step coding tasks
- Integration with all AI engines

**ConversationManager** 
- Session lifecycle management
- Context retention across interactions
- User preference learning
- Conversation history and replay

#### Phase 6.4: Enhanced CLI Integration
- New AI-specific CLI commands leveraging engines
- Streaming responses for long-running operations
- Progress indicators and cancellation support
- Integration with existing CLI infrastructure

#### Phase 6.5: Prompt Templates and System Integration
- Structured prompt templates for each engine type
- Context injection for project-specific information
- Template validation and testing framework
- Performance optimization for prompt generation

### Technical Requirements

**AI Engine Implementation Pattern**:
```elixir
defmodule Aiex.AI.Engines.CodeAnalyzer do
  use GenServer
  @behaviour Aiex.AI.Behaviours.AIEngine
  
  # Integrate with ModelCoordinator for LLM requests
  # Use TemplateEngine for structured prompts
  # Publish events via EventBus
  # Cache results in ETS for performance
  # Integrate with Context.Manager for project context
end
```

**Integration Points**:
1. **LLM Integration**: Use ModelCoordinator.process_request/2 for all LLM calls
2. **Context Integration**: Leverage Context.Manager for project understanding
3. **Event Publishing**: Publish metrics and results via EventBus
4. **Template Usage**: Use TemplateEngine for consistent prompt generation
5. **Caching**: Implement ETS-based caching for performance
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with circuit breaker patterns

**Testing Strategy**:
- Mock-based unit tests for engine logic
- Integration tests with actual LLM responses
- Performance tests for large codebases  
- Distributed testing across cluster nodes
- Template validation and rendering tests

**Security Considerations**:
- Use Sandbox.PathValidator for all file operations
- Implement audit logging for all AI interactions
- Validate all inputs at engine boundaries
- Secure context handling to prevent information leakage

### Success Criteria
1. All AI engines implement AIEngine behaviour correctly
2. Engines integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure
3. Performance meets requirements (sub-second for simple operations)
4. Comprehensive test coverage (>90% for engine logic)
5. CLI commands provide rich AI functionality
6. Distributed operation works across cluster nodes
7. Error handling and fault tolerance maintain system stability

### Deliverables
- 5 AI engines with full functionality
- 2 AI coordinators for workflow orchestration
- Enhanced CLI with AI commands
- Comprehensive test suites
- Prompt template library
- Documentation and usage examples
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
