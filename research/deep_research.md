# Implementing Research and Deep Search Features for Aiex OTP Application

Based on comprehensive research into state-of-the-art techniques and distributed system considerations, here's a detailed guide for implementing research and deep search capabilities in your Aiex OTP application.

## State-of-the-art approaches from leading coding assistants

The current generation of coding assistants has converged on several key architectural patterns for implementing research and deep search features. **GitHub Copilot's instant semantic code search can index entire repositories in under 60 seconds**, using a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that combines vector databases with traditional search. Cursor IDE implements a multi-model approach with its Composer agent mode, enabling end-to-end task completion while maintaining developer control. Sourcegraph Cody leverages a hybrid retrieval system that combines keyword searches, semantic embeddings, and dependency analysis to understand large codebases.

All leading platforms employ some form of RAG architecture with vector databases and embeddings as the foundation. The trend is toward agent-based capabilities with autonomous task completion, self-healing mechanisms, and integration with CI/CD pipelines. Multi-source context retrieval has become standard, pulling from files, documentation, APIs, and external resources simultaneously.

## Technical implementation architecture for Elixir/OTP

For the Aiex application, a distributed search architecture leveraging Elixir's concurrency primitives would be optimal. The core architecture should use GenServers as stateful coordinators for distributed search operations:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.SearchCoordinator do
  use GenServer
  
  def search(query, opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:search, query, opts})
  end
  
  def handle_call({:search, query, opts}, _from, state) do
    tasks = spawn_search_tasks(query, opts)
    results = await_and_aggregate_results(tasks)
    {:reply, results, state}
  end
  
  defp spawn_search_tasks(query, opts) do
    search_sources = [:web_search, :code_index, :documentation, :vector_db]
    
    Enum.map(search_sources, fn source ->
      Task.Supervisor.async({Aiex.TaskSupervisor, source}, 
        Aiex.SearchWorker, :search, [source, query, opts])
    end)
  end
end
```

The supervisor tree should ensure fault tolerance with proper isolation between search components. Using libraries like `libcluster` for automatic node discovery and `Horde` for dynamic process distribution will enable true distributed operation across multiple nodes.

## Web search integration strategy

For web search integration, **Serper API offers the best cost-performance ratio at $0.30 per 1,000 queries with 1-2 second response times**. Tavily API provides AI-optimized search specifically designed for LLM agents. The integration should implement context-aware query enhancement:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.WebSearch do
  def search(query, context) do
    enhanced_queries = [
      "#{query} #{context.language} documentation",
      "#{query} #{context.language} example code",
      "#{query} site:stackoverflow.com OR site:github.com"
    ]
    
    results = Enum.flat_map(enhanced_queries, &execute_search/1)
    |> filter_and_rank_results()
    |> deduplicate_results()
  end
  
  defp filter_and_rank_results(results) do
    trusted_domains = ["stackoverflow.com", "github.com", "docs.python.org"]
    
    Enum.map(results, fn result ->
      score = calculate_relevance_score(result, trusted_domains)
      Map.put(result, :relevance_score, score)
    end)
    |> Enum.sort_by(& &1.relevance_score, :desc)
  end
end
```

## Code repository indexing with vector embeddings

For code search, implement AST-based indexing using tree-sitter for multi-language support combined with vector embeddings for semantic search. **Microsoft's UniXcoder or Voyage-code-2 models provide excellent code understanding capabilities**. Store embeddings in a vector database like Qdrant or pgvector:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.CodeIndexer do
  def index_repository(repo_path) do
    files = discover_code_files(repo_path)
    
    files
    |> Task.async_stream(&index_file/1, max_concurrency: 10)
    |> Stream.filter(&match?({:ok, _}, &1))
    |> Enum.to_list()
  end
  
  defp index_file(file_path) do
    content = File.read!(file_path)
    ast = parse_ast(content, detect_language(file_path))
    
    chunks = extract_semantic_chunks(ast)
    |> Enum.map(fn chunk ->
      embedding = generate_embedding(chunk.code)
      
      %{
        file_path: file_path,
        chunk: chunk,
        embedding: embedding,
        metadata: extract_metadata(chunk)
      }
    end)
    
    store_in_vector_db(chunks)
  end
end
```

## Distributed caching and performance optimization

Implement a multi-level caching strategy using Nebulex for distributed caching across Elixir nodes. **Target sub-300ms P99 latency for search operations** with proper caching:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.Cache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :aiex,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Multilevel
  
  defmodule L1 do
    use Nebulex.Cache,
      otp_app: :aiex,
      adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Local
  end
  
  defmodule L2 do
    use Nebulex.Cache,
      otp_app: :aiex,
      adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Dist
  end
  
  @decorate cacheable(cache: __MODULE__, ttl: :timer.minutes(30))
  def search_with_cache(query) do
    Aiex.SearchService.perform_search(query)
  end
end
```

Use ETS for hot data caching with sub-millisecond access times. Implement cache warming strategies for frequently accessed documentation and code patterns.

## Real-time search with Phoenix channels

Leverage Phoenix channels for streaming search results to provide immediate feedback:

```elixir
defmodule AiexWeb.SearchChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  
  def handle_in("search_stream", %{"query" => query}, socket) do
    Task.start(fn ->
      Aiex.SearchStream.stream_results(query)
      |> Stream.each(fn result ->
        push(socket, "search_result", result)
      end)
      |> Stream.run()
      
      push(socket, "search_complete", %{})
    end)
    
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

## API integration with circuit breakers

Implement robust API integration using Finch with circuit breakers for external services:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.ExternalAPI do
  def search(query) do
    Req.post("https://api.external.com/search",
      json: %{query: query},
      finch: Aiex.Finch,
      retry: :transient,
      max_retries: 3,
      retry_delay: fn attempt -> attempt * 1000 end,
      circuit_breaker: [
        failure_threshold: 0.5,
        recovery_time: 30_000
      ]
    )
  end
end
```

Configure Finch with appropriate connection pools based on expected load:

```elixir
{Finch, 
 name: Aiex.Finch,
 pools: %{
   "https://api.serper.dev" => [size: 20, count: 5],
   "https://api.github.com" => [size: 15, count: 3],
   :default => [size: 10, count: 2]
 }}
```

## Scalability and monitoring

Implement horizontal scaling with auto-scaling triggers based on:
- CPU utilization > 70% sustained
- P95 query latency > 500ms
- Queue depth > 1000 pending requests

Use Broadway for high-throughput document processing during indexing:

```elixir
defmodule Aiex.DocumentProcessor do
  use Broadway
  
  def start_link(_opts) do
    Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
      name: __MODULE__,
      producer: [
        module: {BroadwayRabbitMQ.Producer, [
          queue: "documents_to_index",
          connection: [host: "localhost"]
        ]}
      ],
      processors: [
        default: [concurrency: 10]
      ],
      batchers: [
        vector_db: [concurrency: 5, batch_size: 100]
      ]
    )
  end
end
```

## Conclusion

By combining Elixir/OTP's distributed computing strengths with modern search technologies like vector databases and RAG architectures, Aiex can implement a highly scalable and performant research/deep search feature. The key is leveraging Elixir's concurrency primitives for parallel processing while maintaining fault tolerance through proper supervision trees. Start with a simple implementation using local ETS caching and single-node search, then gradually scale to distributed caching with Nebulex and multi-node coordination using Horde as load increases.
