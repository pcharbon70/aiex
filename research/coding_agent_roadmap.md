# Elixir-based coding assistant implementation roadmap

Building a production-ready coding assistant in Elixir requires careful orchestration of multiple sophisticated components. This comprehensive implementation plan provides specific libraries, patterns, and code examples for each development phase, emphasizing production readiness from the foundation up.

## Phase 1 establishes core infrastructure with robust CLI tooling

The first phase focuses on building a solid foundation with emphasis on security and extensibility. **ExCLI** (`~> 0.1.0`) emerges as the recommended CLI framework for its DSL-based approach and automatic help generation, though **Optimus** (`~> 0.2.0`) provides superior argument validation for complex use cases.

For the context engine, ETS tables configured with read/write concurrency serve as the primary storage mechanism, backed by DETS for persistence. The recommended pattern uses a GenServer wrapper around ETS with proper supervision:

```elixir
defmodule ContextEngine do
  use GenServer
  
  def init(_opts) do
    table = :ets.new(:context_cache, [
      :set, :protected, :named_table,
      read_concurrency: true,
      write_concurrency: true
    ])
    {:ok, %{table: table}}
  end
end
```

File operations require strict sandboxing using `Path.expand/1` for validation and allowlist-based access control. For LLM integration, **Finch** (`~> 0.18.0`) provides the most production-ready HTTP client with connection pooling and HTTP/2 support, while **Hammer** (`~> 6.1`) handles rate limiting effectively using ETS backends.

## Phase 2 introduces sophisticated language processing capabilities

This phase focuses on advanced features that differentiate the assistant. Semantic chunking leverages **Rustler** for safe Tree-sitter integration via NIFs, with **Sourceror** as a pure-Elixir fallback for AST manipulation. The dual approach ensures reliability while maximizing performance:

```elixir
defmodule CodeAssistant.SemanticChunker do
  alias CodeAssistant.Parser.TreeSitterNIF

  def chunk_code(source, opts \\ []) do
    case TreeSitterNIF.parse_elixir_source(source) do
      {:ok, tree} -> extract_semantic_chunks(tree, opts)
      {:error, _} -> fallback_with_sourceror(source, opts)
    end
  end
end
```

Context compression employs sliding window algorithms with token-aware compression, utilizing Erlang's built-in `:zlib` for efficiency. The multi-LLM adapter pattern implements circuit breakers using **BreakerBox** wrapped around Fuse, enabling graceful failover between providers:

```elixir
defmodule CodeAssistant.LLM.AdapterPool do
  def query(prompt, opts \\ []) do
    case get_available_adapter() do
      {:ok, adapter} -> 
        BreakerBox.run(adapter, fn -> adapter.query(prompt, opts) end)
      {:error, :no_adapters} -> 
        {:error, :all_adapters_down}
    end
  end
end
```

Interactive features utilize **Ratatouille** for declarative terminal UIs, while **GenStage** manages event-driven architectures for real-time feedback systems.

## Phase 3 implements robust state management and security

This phase introduces production-grade state management using **Commanded** (`~> 1.4`) for event sourcing with PostgreSQL-backed **EventStore**. This CQRS implementation provides audit trails and time-travel debugging capabilities:

```elixir
defmodule CodingAssistant.Aggregates.Session do
  def execute(%Session{state: :active}, %GenerateCode{} = command) do
    %CodeGenerated{
      session_id: command.session_id,
      code: generate_response(command),
      timestamp: DateTime.utc_now()
    }
  end
end
```

Session persistence combines ETS for fast access with DETS for durability, supervised by DynamicSupervisor for crash recovery. AI-powered test generation integrates with ExUnit through programmatic test registration and **StreamData** for property-based testing.

Security features implement structured audit logging with encryption for sensitive data using AES-256-GCM. Input validation follows OWASP guidelines with pattern matching for injection prevention. The checkpoint system uses versioned state management with efficient Myers diff algorithms for minimal storage overhead.

## Phase 4 optimizes for production deployment

The final phase focuses on operational excellence. Performance profiling uses `:recon` for production-safe diagnostics and **Benchee** (`~> 1.0`) for systematic benchmarking. ETS optimization enables decentralized counters and compression for memory efficiency.

Distributed deployment leverages **libcluster** with DNS strategies for Kubernetes environments. Mix releases provide single-binary deployments with runtime configuration:

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs
import Config
config :myapp, MyApp.Repo,
  url: System.get_env("DATABASE_URL")
```

Telemetry integration connects to monitoring solutions like **AppSignal** or **Prometheus**, while structured logging enables aggregation in production environments. **ExDoc** generates comprehensive documentation with custom grouping and API examples specifically formatted for CLI tools.

Developer tooling includes remote debugging capabilities via distributed Erlang, enhanced IEx helpers for interactive development, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions with caching strategies for dependencies.

## Integration architecture maximizes reliability

The supervision tree orchestrates all components with appropriate restart strategies:

```elixir
defmodule CodingAssistant.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {ContextEngine, []},
      {Finch, name: LLM.HTTPClient, pools: %{
        "https://api.openai.com" => [size: 10]
      }},
      {Hammer.Backend.ETS, []},
      {FileOperations.Supervisor, []}
    ]
    
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

## Performance considerations drive architectural decisions

ETS tables serve as the primary caching layer with proper configuration for concurrent access. Connection pooling manages external API calls efficiently, while circuit breakers prevent cascade failures. Background processing uses Task.async_stream for CPU-bound operations and GenStage for I/O-bound workflows.

Memory management leverages binary pattern matching and reference counting for shared data structures. Garbage collection tuning optimizes for long-running processes typical in coding assistants.

## Security best practices protect user data

All user inputs undergo strict validation with allowlists for file operations. API keys use runtime configuration with secure key management systems. Audit logging tracks all security-relevant events with encryption for sensitive data. Regular security audits using `mix deps.audit` identify vulnerable dependencies.

## Testing strategies ensure reliability

Unit tests cover individual components with property-based testing for edge cases. Integration tests verify component interactions using Mox for external dependencies. Performance tests establish baselines and catch regressions. Fault injection tests validate error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Development workflow recommendations

Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities. Implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates. Monitor error rates and performance metrics continuously. Maintain comprehensive runbooks for operational procedures.

This implementation plan provides a production-ready foundation for an Elixir-based coding assistant, balancing sophisticated features with operational excellence. The modular architecture enables incremental development while maintaining system stability throughout the development cycle.
