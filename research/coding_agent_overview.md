# Architecture Design for an Elixir-Based Coding Assistant

## Executive architectural vision for a next-generation coding assistant

This report presents a comprehensive architectural design for an Elixir-based coding assistant that combines the best practices from Claude-code and Aider-chat while leveraging Elixir's unique strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing. The design addresses all eight specified requirements through a modular, scalable architecture optimized for the BEAM/OTP runtime.

## Core architectural principles drive the system design

The architecture follows a **supervision tree design pattern** with clear separation of concerns across five main subsystems: CLI Interface, Context Management Engine, LLM Integration Layer, File Operation Sandbox, and State Management System. Each subsystem operates as an independent OTP application within an umbrella project, enabling fault isolation and independent scaling.

The system leverages Elixir's **actor model** for natural concurrency, using GenServers for stateful components and Tasks for parallel operations. Process isolation provides inherent security boundaries, while supervision trees ensure automatic recovery from failures. The architecture prioritizes **streaming operations** to handle large codebases efficiently and provides real-time feedback during long-running operations.

## Command-line interface design balances power with usability

The CLI adopts a **verb-noun command structure** inspired by successful tools like git and docker, with commands such as `elixir-assist generate module`, `elixir-assist context add`, and `elixir-assist config set`. The interface supports three interaction modes: interactive REPL-style sessions with context persistence, batch mode for CI/CD integration, and a hybrid mode that allows switching between interactive and automated operations.

**Progressive disclosure** guides users from simple to complex operations. Basic commands like `assist "refactor this function"` work immediately, while advanced users can access fine-grained control through flags and configuration files. The CLI provides real-time progress indicators using ANSI escape codes, with automatic fallback for non-interactive terminals.

Command handling follows a **pipeline architecture**:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.CLI.Pipeline do
  def process_command(input) do
    input
    |> Parser.parse()
    |> Validator.validate()
    |> Router.route()
    |> Executor.execute()
    |> Presenter.format()
  end
end
```

## Context management employs a sophisticated hybrid strategy

The context engine implements **three configurable strategies** that can be combined based on project characteristics:

**Summary-based compression** uses Bumblebee-powered models to create hierarchical summaries at function, module, and application levels. The system maintains summary freshness through file modification tracking and git hooks, automatically updating summaries when code changes.

**Semantic chunking** leverages tree-sitter NIFs for AST-based code parsing, creating semantically meaningful chunks that preserve syntactic integrity. The chunking algorithm adapts chunk sizes based on code complexity and available context window, using embedding similarity to group related code sections.

**Hybrid mode** combines both approaches dynamically, using repository analysis to determine optimal strategies for different file types. Configuration files use summary-based compression, while core business logic employs semantic chunking. The system tracks effectiveness metrics to improve strategy selection over time.

Context storage uses a **tiered memory architecture**:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.Context.Storage do
  # Hot tier: ETS for frequently accessed context
  # Warm tier: DETS for session persistence  
  # Cold tier: Compressed files for historical context
  
  def store_context(session_id, context) do
    :ets.insert(:hot_cache, {session_id, context})
    schedule_tier_migration(session_id)
  end
end
```

## Deep Elixir tooling integration enhances developer workflows

**Mix task integration** provides seamless access to AI capabilities within existing workflows. Custom tasks like `mix ai.gen.module`, `mix ai.test`, and `mix ai.refactor` integrate naturally with Elixir projects. The tasks respect Mix project structure and configurations, automatically detecting umbrella applications and dependencies.

**IEx integration** enables interactive AI-assisted development through custom helpers:
```elixir
# In .iex.exs
import ElixirAssist.IEx.Helpers

# Usage in IEx:
iex> ai_complete("def process_order(order) do")
iex> ai_explain(MyModule.complex_function/2)
iex> ai_test(MyModule)
```

**ExUnit integration** supports AI-powered test generation and enhancement. The system analyzes existing tests to understand patterns, generates comprehensive test cases for new functions, and suggests property-based tests using StreamData. Integration with ExUnit formatters provides real-time feedback on AI-generated test quality.

## Sandboxed file operations ensure security without sacrificing functionality

The sandbox implements a **multi-layer security architecture** combining OS-level and application-level protections. At the OS level, the system uses Linux namespaces and seccomp-BPF when available, falling back to process-based isolation on other platforms.

**Path validation** occurs at multiple levels:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.Sandbox.PathValidator do
  def validate_path(path, sandbox_root) do
    with {:ok, canonical} <- canonicalize(path),
         :ok <- check_traversal(canonical),
         :ok <- verify_within_sandbox(canonical, sandbox_root) do
      {:ok, canonical}
    end
  end
  
  defp check_traversal(path) do
    if String.contains?(path, ["../", "..\\"]) do
      {:error, :traversal_attempt}
    else
      :ok
    end
  end
end
```

Write operations are **restricted to the current directory and descendants**, while read operations can access external files through an explicit allowlist. The system maintains an audit log of all file operations, enabling forensic analysis and compliance reporting.

## Confirmation mechanisms balance safety with workflow efficiency

The confirmation system implements **progressive trust levels**. Initial operations require explicit confirmation with detailed diffs, while repeated similar operations can use abbreviated confirmations. Users can configure trust levels per operation type, file pattern, or LLM model.

**Smart diff presentation** highlights semantic changes rather than syntactic noise:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.Confirmation.DiffPresenter do
  def present_changes(changes) do
    changes
    |> group_by_impact_level()
    |> highlight_breaking_changes()
    |> add_risk_indicators()
    |> format_for_terminal()
  end
end
```

The system supports **dry-run mode** for all operations, generating detailed reports of planned changes without modification. Batch operations group related changes for coherent review, reducing confirmation fatigue while maintaining safety.

## Multi-LLM support provides flexibility and resilience

The LLM integration layer implements an **adapter pattern** supporting both commercial (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and open-source models (Llama, Mistral via Ollama). Each adapter translates provider-specific APIs to a common interface:

```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.LLM.Adapter do
  @callback query(prompt :: String.t(), options :: keyword()) :: 
    {:ok, response} | {:error, reason}
    
  @callback stream(prompt :: String.t(), options :: keyword()) ::
    {:ok, Stream.t()} | {:error, reason}
    
  @callback models() :: [String.t()]
end
```

**API key management** uses a hierarchical configuration system with environment variables taking precedence over configuration files. Keys are stored encrypted at rest and never logged. The system supports key rotation without service interruption through versioned key management.

**Intelligent retry logic** implements circuit breakers and exponential backoff:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.LLM.RetryStrategy do
  def with_retry(fun, opts \\ []) do
    max_attempts = Keyword.get(opts, :max_attempts, 3)
    backoff = Keyword.get(opts, :backoff, :exponential)
    
    Stream.iterate(0, &(&1 + 1))
    |> Stream.take(max_attempts)
    |> Enum.reduce_while(nil, fn attempt, _ ->
      case fun.() do
        {:ok, result} -> {:halt, {:ok, result}}
        {:error, reason} ->
          delay = calculate_delay(attempt, backoff)
          Process.sleep(delay)
          {:cont, {:error, reason}}
      end
    end)
  end
end
```

## Configuration loading supports flexible, composable rules

The configuration system follows a **hierarchical loading pattern** with clear precedence: command-line flags override environment variables, which override project configuration, which overrides user configuration, which overrides system defaults.

Configuration files use **TOML format** for human readability:
```toml
[context]
strategy = "hybrid"
max_tokens = 8000
compression_threshold = 0.8

[sandbox]
write_paths = ["./src", "./test"]
read_paths = ["./deps", "~/.asdf"]
require_confirmation = true

[llm.openai]
model = "gpt-4"
temperature = 0.2
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

**Hot reloading** enables configuration changes without restart:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.Config.Watcher do
  use GenServer
  
  def init(config_path) do
    :fs.subscribe()
    {:ok, %{path: config_path, config: load_config(config_path)}}
  end
  
  def handle_info({:fs, :file_event, {path, _events}}, state) do
    new_config = load_config(path)
    broadcast_config_change(new_config)
    {:noreply, %{state | config: new_config}}
  end
end
```

## Context usage tracking enables intelligent resource management

The system implements **real-time token counting** using model-specific tokenizers provided through Bumblebee. A dedicated GenServer tracks usage across all operations:

```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.Context.UsageTracker do
  use GenServer
  
  defstruct tokens_used: 0, 
            token_limit: 8000,
            compression_triggers: []
  
  def track_usage(tokens) do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:add_tokens, tokens})
  end
  
  def handle_cast({:add_tokens, tokens}, state) do
    new_state = %{state | tokens_used: state.tokens_used + tokens}
    
    if compression_needed?(new_state) do
      trigger_compression()
    end
    
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end
```

**Automatic compression** triggers at configurable thresholds (default 80% of limit). The system uses a priority queue to determine which context to compress first, preserving recently accessed and frequently used context. Compression operations run asynchronously to avoid blocking active operations.

## State management ensures reliability across long-running sessions

The state management system uses **event sourcing** for full auditability:
```elixir
defmodule ElixirAssist.State.EventStore do
  def append_event(session_id, event) do
    event
    |> add_metadata()
    |> serialize()
    |> persist_to_disk()
    |> broadcast_to_subscribers()
  end
  
  def replay_events(session_id, from \\ :beginning) do
    session_id
    |> read_events_from_disk(from)
    |> Stream.map(&deserialize/1)
    |> Enum.reduce(initial_state(), &apply_event/2)
  end
end
```

**Checkpoint creation** occurs automatically at logical boundaries (completed operations, context compression, configuration changes). Manual checkpoints can be created with descriptive names for easy recovery. The system maintains the last 10 checkpoints by default, with configurable retention policies.

**Session recovery** handles both graceful and crash recovery scenarios. On startup, the system checks for interrupted sessions and offers recovery options. Partial operations can be rolled back or completed based on available state information.

## Production deployment considerations shape the final architecture

The system supports **distributed deployment** across multiple nodes using Elixir's native clustering capabilities. Context and state can be partitioned across nodes with consistent hashing for load distribution. The architecture supports both vertical scaling (larger instances) and horizontal scaling (more nodes).

**Monitoring and observability** integrate with standard tools:
- Telemetry events for all major operations
- Prometheus metrics for performance tracking
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Distributed tracing for complex operations

**Performance optimizations** include:
- Connection pooling for LLM API calls
- Batch processing for multiple file operations  
- Streaming responses to reduce memory usage
- Background processing for non-critical tasks
