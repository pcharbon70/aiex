    {:ok, %{
      active_plans: %{},
      plan_queue: :queue.new(),
      llm_agents: []
    }}
  end
  
  def handle_call({:execute_plan, plan_id, goals}, from, state) do
    new_state = state
    |> put_in([:active_plans, plan_id], %{goals: goals, caller: from, status: :planning})
    
    :ok = GenServer.cast(PlannerProcess, {:create_plan, plan_id, goals})
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end
```

### State Machine Implementation

```elixir
defmodule PlanExecutor do
  @behaviour :gen_statem
  
  def callback_mode(), do: :state_functions
  
  def executing(:internal, :execute_step, Data) do
    case execute_current_step(Data) do
      {:ok, result} ->
        new_data = advance_step(Data, result)
        if has_more_steps?(new_data) do
          {:keep_state, new_data, [{:next_event, :internal, :execute_step}]}
        else
          {:next_state, :completed, new_data}
        end
      {:error, reason} ->
        {:next_state, :failed, Map.put(Data, :error, reason)}
    end
  end
end
```

  use Supervisor
  
  def init(_init_arg) do
    children = [
      {PlanningCoordinator, []},
      {PlanStorage, []},
      {PlanningSystem.AgentSupervisor, []},
      {PlanningSystem.ExecutionSupervisor, []},
      {PlanningSystem.MetricsSupervisor, []}

    %PlanCreated{
      plan_id: command.plan_id,
      goals: command.goals,
      created_by: command.user_id,
      created_at: DateTime.utc_now()
    }
  end
  
  def apply(%__MODULE__{} = plan, %PlanCreated{} = event) do
    %{plan |
      id: event.plan_id,
      state: :created,
      goals: event.goals,
      created_at: event.created_at
    }
  end
end
```

### Distributed Coordination with Process Groups

defmodule PlanningSystem.AgentRegistry do
  use GenServer
  
  @agent_group "planning_agents"
  
  def init(_) do
    :ok = :pg.create(@agent_group)
    :ok = :pg.join(@agent_group, self())
    {:ok, %{local_agents: [], remote_agents: []}}
  end
  
  def handle_cast({:register_agent, agent_pid, capabilities}, state) do
    local_agents = [%{pid: agent_pid, capabilities: capabilities} | state.local_agents]
    
    message = {:agent_registered, node(), agent_pid, capabilities}
    broadcast_to_group(@agent_group, message)
