# Aiex

**AI-powered Elixir coding assistant** leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to enhance your Elixir development workflow.

Aiex is a sophisticated coding assistant that combines Elixir's strengths in concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing with modern AI capabilities to help developers write better code faster.

## Implementation Progress

**16-Week Development Roadmap** following a structured approach with four major phases.

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4) ✅ 50% Complete

**CLI Framework** ✅ - Rich terminal UI with Owl + Optimus for verb-noun commands  
**Context Management Engine** ✅ - ETS/DETS-backed storage with tiered memory architecture  
**Sandboxed File Operations** ✅ - Secure file operations with path validation and audit logging  
**Basic LLM Integration** 🔄 - Single-provider support with rate limiting and retries  
**Mix Task Integration** ⏳ - Essential tasks like `mix ai.gen.module` and `mix ai.explain`

### Phase 2: Advanced Language Processing (Weeks 5-8) ⏳

**Semantic Chunking** - Tree-sitter integration via Rustler NIFs with Sourceror fallback  
**Context Compression** - Token-aware compression with sliding window algorithms  
**Multi-LLM Adapters** - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models with failover  
**Interactive Features** - Real-time UI with Ratatouille and GenStage event streaming  
**IEx Integration** - AI-powered helpers like `ai_complete/1` and `ai_explain/1`

### Phase 3: State Management & Testing (Weeks 9-12) ⏳

**Event Sourcing** - CQRS/Event Sourcing with Commanded for full auditability  
**Session Persistence** - Crash recovery and session management with DynamicSupervisor  
**AI Test Generation** - ExUnit and property-based test generation with StreamData  
**Security & Audit** - AES-256-GCM encryption, RBAC, and structured audit logging  
**Checkpoint System** - Versioned state management with Myers diff algorithm

### Phase 4: Production Optimization (Weeks 13-16) ⏳

**Performance Profiling** - Production diagnostics with :recon and Benchee  
**Distributed Deployment** - Clustering with libcluster and consistent hashing  
**Monitoring & Observability** - Telemetry, Prometheus metrics, and distributed tracing  
**Release Engineering** - Mix releases with runtime config and container support  
**Developer Tools** - ExDoc documentation, debugging tools, and CI/CD pipelines

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aiex.git
cd aiex
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
mix deps.get
```

3. Build the executable:
```bash
mix escript.build
```

4. Run Aiex:
```bash
./aiex --help
```

### System Installation (Coming Soon)
Aiex will be available on Hex for easy installation:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aiex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show help
./aiex --help

# Show version information  
./aiex version

# Get help for specific commands
./aiex help create
./aiex help analyze

# Create new projects (coming soon)
./aiex create project --name my_app --template web

# Analyze code (coming soon)
./aiex analyze code --path ./lib --depth 3
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Compile the project
mix compile

# Run tests
mix test

# Format code
mix format

# Start interactive shell
iex -S mix

# Build executable
mix escript.build
```

## Architecture

Aiex follows a clean architectural design with five main subsystems:

1. **CLI Interface** - Verb-noun command structure with rich terminal UI
2. **Context Management Engine** - Hybrid compression and semantic chunking
3. **LLM Integration Layer** - Multi-provider support with failover
4. **File Operation Sandbox** - Security-focused file operations
5. **State Management System** - Event sourcing for auditability

### Key Design Principles
- **Actor Model** - GenServers for stateful components
- **Process Isolation** - Security boundaries through process separation  
- **Supervision Trees** - Fault tolerance and automatic recovery
- **Streaming Operations** - Handle large codebases efficiently
- **Event Sourcing** - Complete audit trail and time-travel debugging

See [detailed implementation plan](planning/detailed_implementation_plan.md) for complete roadmap.
